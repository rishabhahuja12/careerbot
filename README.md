## 📑 How It Works

1. AI Agent is created in **IBM Watsonx.ai Studio**
2. Custom **instructions and guardrails** are set to limit hallucination
3. Multiple `.txt` learning files are uploaded to the **Vector Index**
4. Agent responds using **Granite LLM + RAG**, ensuring answers are factual and document-backed
5. Students ask queries like:
   - *"What career options are available for a PCM student?"*
   - *"What skills are needed to be a Data Scientist?"*
