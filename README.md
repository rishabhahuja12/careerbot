# CareerBot: Agentic AI Career Counseling for IBM SkillsBuild Internship 2025

**CareerBot** is a smart, document-powered AI agent designed to provide personalized career counseling to Indian students. Built using **IBM Watsonx.ai**, **Granite LLM**, and **Vector Indexing (RAG)**, it answers career-related queries grounded in curated documents uploaded by the developer. 

This project was developed as part of the **IBM SkillsBuild for Academia Internship 2025**, showcasing prompt engineering, agentic orchestration, and no-code deployment on IBM Cloud.

## How It Works

1. AI Agent is created in **IBM Watsonx.ai Studio**
2. Custom **instructions and guardrails** are set to limit hallucination
3. Multiple `.txt` learning files are uploaded to the **Vector Index**
4. Agent responds using **Granite LLM + RAG**, ensuring answers are factual and document-backed
5. Students ask queries like:
   - *"What career options are available for a PCM student?"*
   - *"What skills are needed to be a Data Scientist?"*
